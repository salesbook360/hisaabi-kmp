```
TransactionsList → (Click Transaction) → TransactionDetail → (Back) → TransactionsList
```

### Dependency Injection

Updated `TransactionsModule.kt` to include:
- `GetTransactionWithDetailsUseCase` use case

- **Cancelled**: Error color

### Responsive Layout
- Uses LazyColumn for efficient scrolling
- Cards with proper spacing
- Hierarchical information display
- Proper padding and margins

## Usage

### Viewing Transaction Details

1. Navigate to the Transactions List screen
2. Tap on any transaction card
3. View comprehensive details based on transaction type
4. Use the back button to return to the list

### Actions Available (Placeholder)
- Edit transaction (placeholder)
- Share transaction (placeholder)
- Generate Receipt (placeholder)
- Print (placeholder)
- Delete (placeholder)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Edit Functionality**: Navigate to appropriate edit screen based on transaction type
2. **Receipt Generation**: Generate PDF/Image receipts
3. **Print Support**: Platform-specific print functionality
4. **Share Feature**: Share transaction details via email/messaging
5. **Transaction Timeline**: Show history of changes
6. **Related Transactions**: Link to parent/child transactions
7. **Payment History**: For transactions with multiple payments
8. **Attachment Support**: Show attached documents/images
9. **Comments/Notes**: Add internal notes to transactions
10. **Audit Trail**: Show who created/modified the transaction

## Testing Recommendations

To test the implementation:

1. **Create various transaction types**:
   - Regular sale with multiple products
   - Purchase with discounts and taxes
   - Record types (meetings, tasks, notes)
   - Payment transactions
   - Expense and income entries
   - Stock adjustments and transfers

2. **Verify display for each type**:
   - Check all fields are displayed correctly
   - Verify calculations (subtotals, taxes, discounts)
   - Ensure party information shows when present
   - Confirm warehouse and payment method details

   - Navigate from list to detail
   - Navigate back to list
   - Test with missing transaction slug

4. **Error handling**:
   - Test with non-existent transaction ID
   - Test with incomplete transaction data
