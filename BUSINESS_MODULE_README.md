# Business Module - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete business module has been created following the existing project structure. The module allows users to manage their business information with full CRUD operations integrated with the local database.

## Module Structure

### 1. Domain Layer
**Location:** `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/business/domain/`

#### Models
- **Business.kt**: Domain model representing a business
  - Fields: id, title, email, address, phone, logo, slug
  - Simple, focused model for business information

#### Use Cases
- **GetBusinessesUseCase.kt**: Retrieves all businesses or by ID
- **AddBusinessUseCase.kt**: Creates new businesses with validation (including email validation)
- **UpdateBusinessUseCase.kt**: Updates existing businesses
- **DeleteBusinessUseCase.kt**: Deletes businesses
- **BusinessUseCases.kt**: Aggregates all use cases

### 2. Data Layer
**Location:** `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/business/data/`

#### Repository
- **BusinessRepository.kt**: 
  - Manages data operations between domain and data layers
  - Converts between domain models and database entities
  - Handles error cases with Result types

#### Data Source
- **BusinessLocalDataSource.kt** (already existed in database/datasource/):
  - Interface and implementation for database operations
  - Wraps BusinessDao operations

### 3. Presentation Layer
**Location:** `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/business/presentation/`

#### ViewModels
- **MyBusinessViewModel.kt**: 
  - Manages business list state
  - Handles loading, deleting operations
  - Provides reactive state updates via StateFlow

- **AddBusinessViewModel.kt**:
  - Manages add/edit business form state
  - Validates user input (including email format)
  - Handles save operations
  - Supports both create and edit modes

#### UI Screens
- **MyBusinessScreen.kt**:
  - Displays list of businesses
  - Shows business details (title, email, phone, address)
  - Provides delete functionality with confirmation dialog
  - Empty state with call-to-action
  - Click to edit businesses
  - Visual icons for contact information

- **AddBusinessScreen.kt**:
  - Form for creating/editing businesses
  - Fields: Business Name (required), Email, Phone, Address
  - Email validation with proper format checking
  - Form validation with error messages
  - Different UI for create vs edit mode

### 4. Dependency Injection
**Location:** `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/business/di/`

- **BusinessModule.kt**: 
  - Configures Koin dependency injection
  - Provides all use cases, repository, data source, and ViewModels

## Database Integration

The module uses the existing database infrastructure:

### Database Entity
- **BusinessEntity.kt** (already existed in database/entity/)
- **BusinessDao.kt** (already existed in database/dao/)
- **BusinessLocalDataSource.kt** (already existed in database/datasource/)

The DAO provides:
- CRUD operations
- Flow-based reactive queries
- Slug-based unique identification

## Navigation Integration

### App.kt Updates
Added two new screens to the navigation:
- `MY_BUSINESS`: List screen
- `ADD_BUSINESS`: Add/Edit screen

Navigation flow:
1. Home Menu → My Business → List of businesses
2. Click "+" button → Add new business
3. Click business item → Edit business

### HomeScreen.kt Updates
- Added `onNavigateToMyBusiness` callback parameter
- Passes callback to HomeMenuScreen

### MenuScreen.kt Updates
- Added `onNavigateToMyBusiness` callback parameter
- Linked "My Business" menu item to navigation callback

### initKoin.kt Updates
- Added `businessModule` to Koin modules list

## Features

### My Business List Screen
✅ Display all businesses with:
  - Business name
  - Email with envelope icon
  - Phone with phone icon
  - Address with location icon
  - Delete button with confirmation dialog

✅ Empty state with add button
✅ Loading state with progress indicator
✅ Error handling with snackbar
✅ Floating action button to add new business

### Add/Edit Business Screen
✅ Create new businesses with:
  - Business Name (required)
  - Email (optional, validated)
  - Phone (optional)
  - Address (optional, multiline)

✅ Edit existing businesses:
  - Update all fields
  - Email validation on save

✅ Form validation:
  - Required field validation
  - Email format validation
  - Duplicate name prevention

✅ Loading state during save
✅ Error messages display
✅ Auto-navigation on success

## Data Flow

```
UI Layer (Composables)
    ↓
ViewModels (State Management)
    ↓
Use Cases (Business Logic)
    ↓
Repository (Data Coordination)
    ↓
Data Source (Database Operations)
    ↓
DAO (Room Database)
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Slug Generation**: Auto-generated from title + timestamp for uniqueness
2. **Email Validation**: Regex-based validation for proper email format
3. **Contact Information**: Comprehensive fields for business contact details
4. **Error Handling**: Uses Kotlin Result type for operation outcomes
5. **Reactive Updates**: Uses Flow for automatic UI updates
6. **Logo Support**: Includes logo field for future image upload functionality

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Use case validation logic (especially email validation)
- Repository mapping functions
- ViewModel state management
- Email format validation regex

### Integration Tests
- Database operations
- Navigation flow
- Form validation
- Email validation edge cases

### UI Tests
- Business list display
- Add/edit form interactions
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Email field validation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Logo Upload**: Add image picker and upload functionality
2. **Multi-business Support**: Switch between multiple businesses
3. **Business Settings**: Tax rates, currency, fiscal year
4. **Social Media**: Add social media links
5. **Website**: Add website URL field
6. **Business Hours**: Operating hours configuration
7. **Multiple Locations**: Support for businesses with multiple branches
8. **Business Documents**: Store business registration, tax documents
9. **QR Code**: Generate business QR code for quick sharing
10. **Export**: Export business information to PDF/vCard

## Usage Example

```kotlin
// In your navigation code
when (currentScreen) {
    AppScreen.MY_BUSINESS -> {
        MyBusinessScreen(
            viewModel = koinInject(),
            onBusinessClick = { business ->
                // Navigate to edit
            },
            onAddBusinessClick = {
                // Navigate to add
            },
            onNavigateBack = { /* Go back */ }
        )
    }
}
```

## Comparison with Other Modules

| Feature | Business | Warehouses | Payment Methods |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Contact Info** | ✅ Email, Phone, Address | ✅ Address, Location | ❌ No |

- The module follows the same architecture as Payment Methods and Warehouses modules
- All operations are asynchronous using coroutines
- UI follows Material Design 3 guidelines
- Fully integrated with existing navigation system
- Email validation ensures data quality
- Ready for logo upload integration

## Integration with Other Modules

The Business module is designed to integrate with:
- **Auth Module**: Link businesses to user accounts
- **Parties Module**: Associate parties with businesses
