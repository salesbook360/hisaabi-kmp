# Business Module Cloud Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Business module from local database storage to cloud-based API. This document summarizes all changes made during the migration.

## Date
October 22, 2025

## API Endpoints
All business CRUD operations now use the following cloud API endpoints:

### Base URL
```
http://52.20.167.4:5000
```

### Endpoints
1. **Get All Businesses**: `GET /business`
   - Fetches all businesses for the authenticated user
   
2. **Create Business**: `POST /business`
   - Creates a new business
   - Request body: `BusinessRequest`
   
3. **Update Business**: `PUT /business`
   - Updates an existing business
   - Request body: `BusinessRequest` (with business ID)
   
4. **Delete Business**: `POST /delete_business`
   - Deletes a business by slug
   - Headers: `business_key: <slug>`
   - Body: `"<slug>"`

## Files Created

### 1. Business API Models
**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/business/data/model/BusinessApiModels.kt`

Created data transfer objects for API communication:
- `BusinessDto`: Business data transfer object
- `BusinessRequest`: Request body for create/update operations
- `BusinessResponse`: Success response wrapper
- `BusinessData`: Response data container
- `DeleteBusinessResponse`: Delete operation response

Also includes extension functions for mapping between domain models and DTOs:
- `BusinessDto.toDomainModel()`: Converts DTO to domain model
- `Business.toDto()`: Converts domain model to DTO
- `Business.toRequest()`: Converts domain model to request

### 2. Business Remote Data Source
**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/business/data/datasource/BusinessRemoteDataSource.kt`

Created interface and implementation for remote API calls:
- `BusinessRemoteDataSource`: Interface defining API operations
- `BusinessRemoteDataSourceImpl`: Implementation using Ktor HttpClient

Methods:
- `getAllBusinesses()`: Fetches all businesses
- `createBusiness(request)`: Creates a new business
- `updateBusiness(request)`: Updates an existing business
- `deleteBusiness(slug)`: Deletes a business by slug

## Files Modified

### 1. Business Repository
**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/business/data/repository/BusinessRepository.kt`

**Changes**:
- Replaced `BusinessLocalDataSource` dependency with `BusinessRemoteDataSource`
- Updated all methods to use remote API calls instead of local database
- Changed `getAllBusinesses()` to return a Flow that emits API response
- Added proper error handling for API responses
- Removed entity mapping functions (replaced with DTO mapping)

**Key Changes**:
- `getAllBusinesses()`: Now fetches from API and emits results as Flow
- `insertBusiness()`: Calls create API endpoint
- `updateBusiness()`: Calls update API endpoint
- `deleteBusiness()`: Calls delete API endpoint (requires slug)
- `getBusinessById()` and `getBusinessBySlug()`: Now fetch from API and filter locally

### 2. Business Module (Dependency Injection)
**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/business/di/BusinessModule.kt`

**Changes**:
- Removed `BusinessLocalDataSource` dependency registration
- Added `BusinessRemoteDataSource` dependency registration
- Updated repository injection to use remote data source
- Uses HttpClient from authModule for API calls

**Before**:
```kotlin
single<BusinessLocalDataSource> { BusinessLocalDataSourceImpl(get()) }
single { BusinessRepository(get()) }
```

**After**:
```kotlin
single<BusinessRemoteDataSource> { BusinessRemoteDataSourceImpl(get()) }
single { BusinessRepository(get()) }
```

### 3. Database Module
**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/database/di/DatabaseModule.kt`

**Changes**:
- Commented out `businessDao()` registration
- Commented out `BusinessLocalDataSource` registration
- Added comments indicating Business module now uses remote API

```

## Authentication
The Business API uses the same authentication mechanism as other APIs:
- Uses Bearer token authentication
- Token is automatically attached via HttpClient Auth plugin
- Token is retrieved from `AuthLocalDataSource`
- User must be logged in to access business endpoints

## Use Cases (Unchanged)
The following use cases remain unchanged and continue to work with the new cloud-based repository:
- `GetBusinessesUseCase`: Get all businesses
- `AddBusinessUseCase`: Add new business with validation
- `UpdateBusinessUseCase`: Update existing business with validation
- `DeleteBusinessUseCase`: Delete business

## ViewModels (Unchanged)
The following ViewModels remain unchanged:
- `MyBusinessViewModel`: Manages business list state
- `AddBusinessViewModel`: Manages add/edit business form state

## UI Screens (Unchanged)
The following UI screens remain unchanged:
- `MyBusinessScreen`: Displays list of businesses
- `AddBusinessScreen`: Form for adding/editing businesses

## Data Flow

### Fetching Businesses
1. User opens MyBusinessScreen
2. MyBusinessViewModel calls `useCases.getBusinesses()`
3. GetBusinessesUseCase calls `repository.getAllBusinesses()`
4. Repository calls `remoteDataSource.getAllBusinesses()`
5. Remote data source makes GET request to `/business`
6. API returns `BusinessResponse` with list of businesses
7. Response is mapped to domain models and emitted via Flow
8. UI updates with business list

### Creating Business
1. User fills form and clicks save
2. AddBusinessViewModel calls `useCases.addBusiness()`
3. AddBusinessUseCase validates input and calls `repository.insertBusiness()`
4. Repository converts domain model to request and calls `remoteDataSource.createBusiness()`
5. Remote data source makes POST request to `/business`
6. API creates business and returns response with new business ID
7. Success result propagates back to UI
8. UI navigates back to business list

### Updating Business
1. User edits business and clicks save
2. AddBusinessViewModel calls `useCases.updateBusiness()`
3. UpdateBusinessUseCase validates input and calls `repository.updateBusiness()`
4. Repository converts domain model to request and calls `remoteDataSource.updateBusiness()`
5. Remote data source makes PUT request to `/business`
6. API updates business and returns response
7. Success result propagates back to UI
8. UI navigates back to business list (auto-refreshes via Flow)

### Deleting Business
1. User clicks delete icon on business
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms deletion
4. MyBusinessViewModel calls `useCases.deleteBusiness()`
5. DeleteBusinessUseCase calls `repository.deleteBusiness()`
6. Repository extracts slug and calls `remoteDataSource.deleteBusiness()`
7. Remote data source makes POST request to `/delete_business`
8. API deletes business and returns response
9. Business list auto-updates via Flow

## Error Handling
- All API calls wrapped in try-catch blocks
- API error responses (statusCode field) are detected and converted to errors
- Network errors are caught and user-friendly messages displayed
- Errors shown in UI via Snackbar (MyBusinessScreen) or error text (AddBusinessScreen)

## Testing Considerations
To test the implementation:
1. Ensure user is logged in (valid auth token)
2. Test fetching businesses (should load from API)
3. Test creating new business (should POST to API)
4. Test updating business (should PUT to API)
5. Test deleting business (should DELETE via API)
6. Test error scenarios (no network, invalid data, etc.)

## Migration Benefits
1. **Centralized Data**: Business data stored in cloud, accessible across devices
2. **Real-time Sync**: Changes immediately available on all devices
3. **Data Backup**: No risk of data loss from device issues
4. **Scalability**: Can handle large number of businesses
5. **Multi-user**: Foundation for future multi-user features

## Backwards Compatibility
- Local database tables (BusinessEntity, BusinessDao) still exist but are unused
- Can be safely removed in future cleanup
- Or can be used for offline caching if needed

## Files Not Changed
The following database files are still present but no longer used by the Business module:
- `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/database/entity/BusinessEntity.kt`
- `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/database/dao/BusinessDao.kt`
- `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hisaabi/hisaabi_kmp/database/datasource/BusinessLocalDataSource.kt`

These can be:
- Kept for potential offline caching implementation
- Removed in a future cleanup PR
- Repurposed for other features

## Known Limitations
1. **No Offline Support**: Requires internet connection to fetch/modify businesses
2. **No Caching**: Each screen visit fetches fresh data from API
3. **Slug Required for Delete**: Businesses must have a slug to be deleted (API requirement)

## Future Enhancements
1. **Offline Caching**: Use local database as cache for offline access
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI before API call completes
3. **Pagination**: If business list grows large
4. **Search/Filter**: Add search and filter capabilities
5. **Image Upload**: Implement logo upload functionality
6. **Sync Status**: Show sync status indicators

## API Contract Assumptions
Based on the provided cURL examples, the following assumptions were made:
1. GET `/business` returns `BusinessResponse` with `data.list` containing businesses
2. POST `/business` creates business and returns it in response
3. PUT `/business` requires business `id` and `slug` in request body
4. DELETE `/delete_business` requires `business_key` header and slug in body
5. All endpoints require Bearer token authentication
6. Response includes either `data` (success) or `statusCode` (error)

## Notes
- The HttpClient is shared with the auth module for consistent configuration
- All API calls include detailed logging for debugging
- The implementation follows the same patterns as the existing auth module
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
